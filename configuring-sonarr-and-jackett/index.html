I know it would have helped me a lot if there was a nice blog post or two explaining a few details when i was looking into setting everything up. Hopefully this post will help anyone in the future!\nSonarr First thing you will see when opening Sonarr will be something similar to this:\nYou will want to click on settings on the menu bar to open the settings menu. This is where we will spend most of the time configuring Sonarr.\nThe first thing we want to do is add a download client. In this example I will be using rTorrent as this is what we have previously installed. Click Download Client \u003e Big plus symbol. This will open a menu where you can select your download client from. Click rTorrent.\nNow you will see a menu where you can fill out the connection details to your rTorrent session. Fill this menu out and click test. If everything is filled out correctly the test will succeed and you can click Save\nJackett On the homepage of Jackett there is a brief explanation on how to add Jackett as an Indexer to CouchPotato, Sonarr and Radarr. Very easy to follow but there is no explanation on how to set up indexers on Jackett.\nTo add an indexer you will need to click the green Add indexer button from the menu just under the API key ( you will need this later ). A huge list of indexers will show find the one you use and click this spanner icon. This will open the settings menu for this indexer. You will have to fill out the information there and click save.\nRepeat these steps for as many indexers as you use.\nSonarr + Jackett Now we need to configure Sonarr to use Jacket. Back on the Sonarr settings page click the Indexers tab and then the big plus symbol.\nClick on Torznab \u003e Custom.\nFill this out with the relevant information. Remember the API key from earlier, this is needed to authenticate Sonarr with Jackett. Once complete press save.\nEverything should now be correctly set up and you can start adding TV shows to be scheduled in for download.\n","wordCount":"438","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2018-06-14T20:13:47Z","dateModified":"2018-06-14T20:13:47Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Josh Rickers"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://homehub.tech/configuring-sonarr-and-jackett/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Home Hub","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://homehub.tech/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://homehub.tech/ accesskey=h title="Home Hub (Alt + H)"><img src=https://homehub.tech/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home Hub</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://homehub.tech/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://homehub.tech/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://homehub.tech/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://homehub.tech/post/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Configuring Sonarr and Jackett</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2018-06-14 20:13:47 +0000 UTC'>June 14, 2018</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;438 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Josh Rickers&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/JoshRickers/HomeHub/tree/main/content/post/configuring-sonarr-and-jackett.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>In one of my previous <a href=/automate-tv-shows-with-sonarr/>blog posts</a> I explained how to install Sonarr, Jackett and RuTorrent using Docker.
