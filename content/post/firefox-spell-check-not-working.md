I noticed that while typing out my previous post that Firefox was not automatically spell checking as I was typing. Coming from Chrome which does this automatically I thought this was something that should work out of the box.

It looks like you need to have a dictionary installed, language pack installed and the option to check spelling ticked.

Make sure you have spell checking enabled. Menu > Options > search for spell check.

Once you know you have that turned on then you can check to see if you have the dictionary installed. Visit the [Dictionary and language pack add on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/language-tools/) page. Scroll to your desired language and and install the dictionary. Give Firefox a quick restart and spell checking will now start working.
